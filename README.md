# Overview
The war card game simulated through text. Because of the simplicity of war, it can be completely computer simulated without user input. Pressing enter plays cards and continues the turn, and enter can be held to simulate turns rapidly. Note that if you're very unlucky, the shuffled deck perfectly aligns such that the game is an infinite tie.
